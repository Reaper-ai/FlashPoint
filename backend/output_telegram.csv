"telegram","disclosetv","NEW - Heat pumps are at risk of explosion due to the ongoing multi-day power outage in southwest Berlin.

Hailed heat pumps of Germany's energy transition, especially monoblock models, often use flammable refrigerants such as propane. During prolonged power outages, safety mechanisms (e.g., pumps or valves) fail, which can lead to gas accumulation or leaks. Ignition sources pose a risk of explosion. Those affected should not operate the devices and consult experts.
