"telegram","disclosetv","NEW - Heat pumps are at risk of explosion due to the ongoing multi-day power outage in southwest Berlin.

Hailed heat pumps of Germany's energy transition, especially monoblock models, often use flammable refrigerants such as propane. During prolonged power outages, safety mechanisms (e.g., pumps or valves) fail, which can lead to gas accumulation or leaks. Ignition sources pose a risk of explosion. Those affected should not operate the devices and consult experts.

"telegram","disclosetv","JUST IN - Maduro pleads not guilty to all charges, says he is a ""decent man"" and still the President of Venezuela.

Maduro added he is a ""prisoner of war."" He told the court that he had not previously seen the indictment and was unaware of his legal rights.

Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, also pleaded not guilty to charges of illegal cocaine trafficking in the U.S., Reuters reports.

Both Maduro and Flores are requesting consular assistance from the Venezuelan embassy.

Judge orders Maduro to appear in court on March 17 for hearing.

"telegram","intelslava","🇺🇸 🇮🇷 🇮🇱 The Jerusalem Post has received multiple indications that the US is considering some intervention in the ongoing Iran protests. At the same time, Israel is also checking if the removal of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro will make action against the Iranian regime possible.

Until the intervention by US President Donald Trump in Caracas, most Israeli officials did not view the protests against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as necessarily approaching the volume necessary to achieve regime change.

There are indications that Washington is weighing some targeted intervention to assist the protest movement to get over the top of the Iranian regime.

More specifically, the Mossad has publicly admitted on Twitter to assisting Iranian protesters in the field.

 It is possible that the US may use some kind of threat of force and even limited force to prevent Khamenei from crushing the protest movement, in order to provide the movement more of a chance to grow.
